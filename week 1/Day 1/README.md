# 📘 SQL Practice - Day 1

## 🚀 Overview

On Day 1, I learned the basics of SQL using simple queries on tables like **Employee**, **Department**, and **Project**. This includes data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, grouping, and joins.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🔹 1. Basic SELECT Queries

* Selecting all columns and specific columns
* Using `SELECT *` and column-based selection

---

### 🔹 2. Filtering Data

* Using `WHERE` clause
* Conditions like:

  * `age > 30`
  * `department_id = 1`
* Pattern matching using:

  * `LIKE 'J%'` (starts with)
  * `LIKE '%a%'` (contains)
  * `LIKE '_o%'` (second character)

---

### 🔹 3. Working with Dates

* Extracting year and month using:

  * `YEAR(hire_date)`
  * `MONTH(hire_date)`
* Filtering based on:

  * specific year (2020)
  * before/after a date
  * between date ranges

---

### 🔹 4. Aggregate Functions

* `SUM()` → total salary
* `AVG()` → average salary
* `MIN()` / `MAX()` → lowest/highest salary
* `COUNT()` → number of employees

---

### 🔹 5. GROUP BY & HAVING

* Grouping data by:

  * department
  * year
* Filtering grouped data using `HAVING`

  * e.g., departments with more than 2 employees

---

### 🔹 6. Sorting Data

* Using `ORDER BY`

  * Ascending (`ASC`)
  * Descending (`DESC`)
* Sorting by multiple columns

---

### 🔹 7. Joins

* `INNER JOIN` → matching records
* `LEFT JOIN` → include unmatched records
* Combining:

  * Employee + Department
  * Employee + Project

---

### 🔹 8. Real-world Queries

* Employees per department
* Salary analysis (avg, total, max)
* Hiring trends (year-wise)
* Department insights

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

* Importance of correct **date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`)**
* Difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`
* How `GROUP BY` changes query behavior
* When to use `JOIN` vs `NATURAL JOIN`
* Writing clean and optimized SQL queries

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* DB Fiddle (online SQL practice)

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

Day 1 helped me build a strong foundation in SQL basics, including querying, filtering, grouping, and joining data. These concepts are essential for real-world database operations and interviews.

# SQL Practice - Day 2

## Overview

In Day 2, I practiced advanced SQL queries using three tables: Employee, Department, and Project. The goal was to understand how to solve real-world problems using SQL.

## What I Did

I wrote queries to:

* Find employees who are not assigned to any project

* Count how many projects each employee’s department is working on

* Find departments that do not have any employees

* Get employees who work in the same department as a specific person

* Find the department with the highest average salary

* Find employees with the highest and second highest salaries

* Compare employee salaries with:

  * overall average salary
  * department average salary

* Find employees based on conditions like:

  * hired on the same date
  * older than others in a department

* Work with project-related data:

  * departments with multiple projects
  * employees working in those departments

* Use date conditions:

  * employees hired in 2020
  * employees hired in the last 2 years

* Perform calculations like:

  * total salary
  * average salary
  * employee count per department

## Key Concepts I Learned

* How to use **JOIN** to combine multiple tables
* How to use **LEFT JOIN** to include missing data
* How to use **GROUP BY** to group records
* How to use **HAVING** to filter grouped results
* How to use **subqueries** to solve complex conditions
* Difference between **WHERE** and **HAVING**
* Handling **NULL values** correctly

## Tools Used

* DB Fiddle (online SQL platform)

## Conclusion

Day 2 helped me understand how to write more advanced SQL queries by combining multiple concepts. I can now solve real-world problems using joins, subqueries, and aggregation.

Next, I will learn advanced topics like window functions and ranking.
